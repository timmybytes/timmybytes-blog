        Yesterday was day 100 of my personal{' '}
        <a href='https://www.100daysofcode.com/'>100DaysOfCode</a> challenge.
        Before beginning, I already had some experience with HTML/CSS, Python,
        and the command line, but my comprehension was limited and mostly
        fragmentary. Over these last few months, however, I’ve completely thrown
        myself into learning to code, web development best practices, and
        computer science theory (in a limited fashion). Here are some tips I’ve
        picked up along the way.

      <h2> Feeling like an imposter can be a good thing </h2>
      <p>
        One of the most common aspects of being a newbie to coding and
        development is the dreaded “Imposter Syndrome”: the feeling of being a
        fraud when you don’t know as much as you think you should, or when
        you’re just sort of faking it until you make it. This mindset is
        particularly applicable to people who’ve just landed their first
        developer job (or even long after), and while it can be stressful and
        depressing to compare yourself to seasoned savants, there’s a simple
        solution—don’t.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re new, you’re new. There’s nothing wrong with that. Not everyone
        learns to write DRY code before they’re out of diapers, and whatever
        path led you to coding at whatever age is a valid one. I’ve spent years
        working in retail, have an unrelated degree in English, and one of the
        things I’ve learned to embrace over this period diving into programming
        has been my lack of knowledge.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        When you don’t know how a particular piece of code works, or what a tool
        does, or why a technology exists, it gives you the opportunity to find
        out. Computer Science is so dense with history and evolution that no one
        person can know it all, but learning to embrace going down wormholes to
        clear up gaps in your knowledge is a useful skill, and along the way
        you’ll find another dozen topics you’ll want to look into later for even
        more clarification. Part of learning to code is learning how to learn,
        and being okay with the fact that there’s always more to find out.{' '}

      <h2>Stick with a central programming language </h2>
      <p>
        You might feel inclined to try and cram as much into your brain as
        possible when starting out, and desire to learn how every popular
        programming language works. This is a recipe for remaining confused and
        staying stuck at the beginner level indefinitely. Instead, focus on one
        language.
      </p>{' '}
      <p>
        For me, I’ve pursued front-end web development, so after getting the
        hang of HTML and CSS (which aren’t really programming languages at all),
        I’ve focused solely on JavaScript. As a result, I’ve deepened my
        knowledge of the language rather than spreading myself thin over many
        others, and this applies to any other language you’re interested in.
      </p>
      <p>
        There isn’t a “right” language to learn first, though some may be better
        suited for you if you’re looking to work with certain realms of
        development or engineering. JavaScript is tailored to web development,
        Python is often the choice for machine learning, Java is popular for
        enterprise software, etc. There are exceptions to all of these, but the
        gist is that once you start with a language, stick with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        A language’s syntax is something you can pick up pretty quickly, or look
        up once you know what you need, but the important thing is to learn the
        concepts of programming and /thinking/ programmatically. Once you’ve
        become adept at one language, it becomes easier to learn another because
        the same underlying concepts will usually apply.

      <h2>Track your progress</h2>
      <p>
        Publicly committing to the <code>#100DaysOfCode</code> challenge gave me
        some accountability for reporting what I’d done each day on Twitter, and
        eventually I started using tools like Toggl Track and Wakatime to record
        the time I was studying and actually working on things. Gamifying your
        progress can be a great incentive to keep trying to up your own
        “scores”, but more than anything it gives you tangible evidence that
        you’re really taking ownership over your own learning. Seeing weekly
        reports of the hours you’ve put in can give you that added boost of
        knowing you’re accomplishing something incrementally, especially if it
        feels like you’re just spinning your wheels in the moment.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, take notes! When you’re watching a tutorial or researching a
        topic that’s unfamiliar to you, it’s immensely helpful to write down
        contexts for why something is the way it is, preferably with examples
        you can refer back to later. I personally recommend using{' '}
        <a href='https://bear.app/'>Bear</a> (it’s what I’m using to write this
        article), a free, full-featured note app that supports markdown and
        syntax highlighting.{' '}

      </ul>
      <h2>Be kind to yourself when you need a break </h2>
      <p>
        Just as tracking your time can make you strive for more time spent
        working, it’s also important to step /away/ from the keyboard. You can’t
        learn everything there is to know about programming by staring at code
        for twelve hours a day, and more often than not life will throw you
        curveballs that will force you to take a break (and 2020 is the year of
        curveballs, if nothing else). Burnout is a very real issue for
        developers, so try to establish good habits from the get go by giving
        yourself time away from the keyboard.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        For me personally, that has meant juggling chronic migraines, raising my
        son, air toxicity (I live in Oregon, where we spent two weeks under a
        blanket of dangerous wildfire smoke), and any number of things on a
        daily basis that could either distract or derail my focus on coding.
        There’s always more I want to be doing, always more I wish I was
        learning, but I’ve learned to be patient and appreciate that even if the
        pace isn’t always as consistent as I’d like, I’m still moving forward
        bit by bit.{' '}

      <h2>Push out of your comfort zone</h2>
      <p>
        When you finally get the hang of a concept, a framework, a tool, etc.,
        it can be easy to fall into the habit of continuing to revisit an area
        where you feel comfortable—and avoid things that you grapple with. This
        was me with JavaScript, which was extremely intimidating to me at first,
        and as a result I kept putting off diving into it.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        But most of the time, doing the thing that seems scary ends up being
        much less frightening than you thought initially, and it makes you get
        comfortable with the knowledge that a) you have a lot to learn, and b)
        you /can/ learn a lot. I spend some part of every day with JavaScript
        now, and I’ve come to really love it’s quirky personality and the
        staggering capabilities it has. I’ve gotten so used to trying things I
        don’t understand, at this point I’ve started making notes and bookmarks
        of complex topics to come back to or work towards.{' '}
      </p>
      <h2>Use your momentum as a spring board</h2>
      <p>
        Learning to code is a daunting undertaking. There’s more to learn than
        any one person can cover in a lifetime, and things are changing all the
        time. It’s easy to get overwhelmed and feel like you aren’t getting
        anywhere, and an important component to the process is to keep pushing
        yourself forward. One of the best ways you can do this is to learn in
        public (by sharing your journey through #100DaysOfCode on Twitter, for
        example), and more directly, to engage with the developer community at
        large.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        As someone who deleted most social media accounts years ago, it can
        often be a hurdle for me to go from passively reading posts and
        following interesting people online to actively engaging with them, but
        I’m trying to get better about it (see the current article you’re
        reading...).{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        More than anything though, if you reach Day 100 of your own challenge,
        keep going. Keep learning, keep coding. Build projects, connect with
        others online to learn from and share with. Do a second round of the
        challenge, or create one for yourself.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        I for one plan to keep coding everyday without exception, and am
        currently trying to land a job in the industry as a developer. I’ve
        realized the passion I have for this stuff seems to know no bounds, and
        completing 100DaysOfCode has only seemed to increase my appetite to
        learn and do more. If you’re just starting your journey, overwhelmed by
        all there is to learn and know, don’t worry. You’ve got this, and there
        are many of us here eager to support you along the way.{' '}
